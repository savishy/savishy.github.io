# DevOps Vision and Strategy for a major Healthcare Enterprise

* _Dates_: Sep to Oct 2017
* _Client_: A US-based Fortune-500 company in the healthcare domain.
* _Role_: DevOps Architect, Team Lead
* _Team Size_: 3

## Project Goals

The role of my team was to work with key stakeholders in the client's ODC to:
* Assess current progress and roadblocks with DevOps automation and conduct a gap analysis.
* Create a coherent, overall DevOps Vision and Strategy.
* Create a DevOps Process Model for effective software delivery.

## Tools Used

* Jenkins (Pipeline-as-Code)
* Docker + Compose + Swarm
* Ansible
* ServerSpec

## Key Impact

I delivered an end-to-end DevOps Vision and implementation strategy for the client. Where feasible, I also drove the initial implementation of a solution to help evangelize the strategy.  

Key aspects of the strategy:
1. Pipeline-as-Code and the application of Continuous Delivery practices
1. An effective, decoupled, container-first application architecture
1. A tightly integrated Deployment Pipeline that enabled realization of DevOps principles of flow and feedback
1. Infrastructure maintained through, and extended by, Code
1. Continuous Testing strategies for source-code, container validation and configuration scripts.

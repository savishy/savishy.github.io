I'd wanted to work at ThoughtWorks ever since I read _Continuous Delivery_ by Jez Humble and consumed articles and videos by other thought leaders such as Martin Fowler. And when I met Sunil Mundra at Agile Gurugram 2018, I really felt like working at a place that could churn out excellence.  

Upon starting the search for a job recently, ThoughtWorks was definitely high on my application list, but I filled out the application more to check a box than anything else. I then resumed applying to places where I _knew_ I had a fighting chance.

I was surprised, therefore, to receive an interview call.

## Key Highlights: Round 1 (HR)

* The initial discussion with the HR itself felt like a screening of sorts. And I feel this was the purpose of the non-technical discussion we had: 
  * detect passion for something (_anything_) technical;
  * identify the ability to communicate thoughts into English words (a consulting organization's bread and butter);
  * deal with administrative things like the notice period, willingness to travel etc.

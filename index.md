Hi, there. I am {{site.data.profile.firstname}} {{site.data.profile.lastname}}, also called {{site.data.profile.nickname}}. A few words about me:

* I am an avid practitioner of DevOps and inject it into *everything* I do. Hit this link to view my resume.
* I love to learn and try never to pass up an opportunity to learn something new.
* I code for fun (and for work). Find some of my work on my [Github profile](http://github.com/savishy).
* I try to help the community when possible. Here's [my StackOverflow profile](http://stackoverflow.com/users/682912).
* I am an avid photographer, budget traveller, chef and gardener. More about that on [Instagram](http://instagram.com/savishy).

This website serves as a summary of my various projects, both on and off work.
